# game-of-life
This repo is intended to be `Conway's Game of Life`, which I'm developing
predominantly for learning and practice purposes.

The goals of this project are to get used to working with c++ in a project that
is of a reasonable size, to learn how to use `CMake` and `Docker`, and write
unit tests using `googletest` in c++
